2.10 - 13th August 2017
-----------------------

* Added support for 64-bit Itanium binary depots (_64 in the depot filename)
  as well as 32-binary depots (_32 in the depot filename). A new -b
  option selects between 32-bit (the current default) and 64-bit
  (a later depothelper release will switch to this as the default once
  the majority of Itanium depots are available in 64-bit). Note that PA-RISC
  depots will remain 32-bit only and you therefore can't use the -b flag on
  the PA-RISC platform.

* Anything involving HP-UX prior to version 11.31 will now display a
  deprecation warning that all pre-HP-UX 11.31 packages
  will be deleted from the archive site on 31st August 2018.

* Anything involving the 32-bit Itanium platform will now display a
  deprecation warning that all 32-bit Itanium packages will be deleted
  from the archive site on 31st August 2018. Don't panic - we're expecting
  to have all 32-bit Itanium depots ported to 64-bit well before that date.

2.00 - 9th February 2010
------------------------

* Fixed the auto-upgrade code, which was badly broken in 1.00.
  This means that this 2.00 release will have to be manually
  upgraded ("depothelper depothelper" might actually do it with the
  1.00 release of depothelper installed), but hopefully is the last
  such release with that requirement.
  
* Added -u option to uninstall the specified packages (and
  their dependencies, providing their parents aren't still
  installed after the specified packages are uninstalled).

* Changed incorrect references to Dante (which is a generic
  SOCKS proxy) to ftpproxy (which is an FTP proxy server new
  to the HP-UX archive).

* If "-e 0" is specified (effectively disabling the download
  cache), any depots downloaded whilst running depothelper will
  now be deleted before the script exits.

* Changed the Progress column to be separate Download and Install
  columns, allowing just one package per line in the output.
  When -u is supplied, the Progress column becomes a single
  (wider) Uninstall column.

* When installing a downloaded depot, any previously installed
  depots with the same package name but a different package
  version will be uninstalled first in oldest to newest order.

* Various minor bug fixes have been applied, mainly to do with
  the layout of the output more than anything else.

1.00 - 2nd February 2010
------------------------

* Initial release.

* Can choose the OS architecture and version of downloaded depots.

* Can specify the directory depots are downloaded and cached to.

* The cache of downloaded depots is maintained for a default of
  3 months, but this can be overridden.

* Can force download and install of depots even if seemingly unnecessary
  (e.g. in case a package-version is reissued on the archive or there
  was a corrupted download or install previously).

* Can download depots and then not install them (e.g. you may be
  downloading to use the depots on another HP-UX box).

* Can specify an FTP proxy server and port if needed to download the
  depots.

* Can remove depots automatically after they have been downloaded and
  installed successfully.

* Auto-detects if there's a new version of depothelper available and
  downloads and installs it, re-running the script once the new version
  is in place.

* Will warn if depothelper is removed from the HP-UX archive (suggesting
  it's either changed its name or been removed because it's no longer
  supported).

* Will download and install any dependencies of a specified package.

* Will download only exactly what is needed (i.e. it won't download a
  package or one of its dependencies if they're in the download cache or
  have been installed already).

* Can list either all installed packages or a set of specified packages
  (whether or not they are installed) along with their dependencies.
